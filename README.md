# code-challenges
 Hello! This is Erik. Thanks for checking out one of my projects.

 This repo just contains small projects and challenges that don't merit their own repo. Usually from coding websites like freeCodeCamp or something like that.

# Current challenges:
 1. Longest word in a sentance - freeCodeCamp - finds the longest word in a sentance
 2. Largest in Array - freeCodeCamp - finds the largest value array in a series of subarrays
